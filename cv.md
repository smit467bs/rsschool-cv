## Briefly about Myself:

My name is Vyacheslav Burdaev, originally from the Republic of Belarus in the city of Bobruisk. Born on August 16,
1998 (age 24). He also served urgent military service in the border service of the Republic of Belarus, thanks to which
he acquired such skills as discipline and tolerance. At the moment I work at one of the largest enterprises for my city
as an instrumentation and control engineer. My main work is closely intertwined with industrial programming, in the
field of this I often have to constantly learn and learn something new, tk. the variety of different programmable logic
controllers and automation devices is very large. At the moment, I want to study this course, with the subsequent
employment in a new field of work. I have basic knowledge of HTML + CSS + JavaScript, easy to learn and want to develop
in this area.
